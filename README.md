[Charter/Spectrum Frontend Challenge Dcoke](https://Dcoke1.github.io/charter-spectrum-challenge/)

### Improvements/Takeaways

- Genres feature could be implemented by creating a seperate array (via push method) dropdown with genres mapped. User would be able to click an item from the dropdown and inserted into the filter search

- More explicitly typed components

- Promises could be made more resuable
